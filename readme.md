# espcontrol

"espcontrol" is a firmware / framework for the esp8266. Espcontrol provide a async webserver, a small lua scripting engine, UDP P2P network and a plugin system for some sensors. You can find an overview over the supported sensors in the docs/reference.md file.

### Release notes:
espcontrol is in an early state of programming, but a lot of features are working. I use the espcontrol to control some RGB LED stripes and to control a pump sump.

Feel free to fork...
